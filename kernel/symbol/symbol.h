/*
 * Kernel symbol self-resolution.
 *
 * Android GKI/KMI kernels no longer export many internal symbols (SELinux,
 * cred, namespace, ...). A module that references one directly fails to load
 * with "Unknown symbol xxx (err -2)". This module recovers the address of
 * kallsyms_lookup_name() with a one-shot kprobe, resolves *all* symbols
 * (exported or not) through it and caches them for name-based lookups.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *   during init:
 *       if (!nksu_ksym_lookup("selinux_state"))
 *           pr_err("cannot resolve selinux_state\n");
 *
 *   afterwards nksu_ksym_lookup() returns function addresses usable through
 *   function pointers, or data addresses usable as pointers to globals.
 */

/*
 * Record a symbol name in the module's .nksu_ksymtab section.
 *
 * Every symbol the module resolves through kallsyms at load time is listed in
 * that table. bootpatcher reads it from nksu.ko and verifies, against the
 * kernel in the target boot image, that every required entry exists before it
 * patches the ramdisk. A missing symbol would otherwise only surface as a
 * failed insmod after a reboot, when recovery is much harder.
 *
 * Entries are (flags byte, NUL-terminated name). Bit 0 marks a symbol the
 * module cannot run without; entries without it are best-effort lookups whose
 * absence the code already tolerates, so bootpatcher only warns about them.
 *
 * The macro emits the entry at the point of use, so NKSU_RESOLVE() and the
 * compile-time nksu_ksym_lookup("name") call sites record themselves without a
 * second, manually maintained list. _name must be a string literal.
