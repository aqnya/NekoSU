/*
 * Runtime patching of an existing LSM hook slot.
 *
 * Ported from KernelSU's hook/lsm_hook.c.  The SELinux hiding feature needs to
 * intercept security_setprocattr()'s SELinux implementation, which the kernel
 * reaches through the LSM hook table rather than the syscall table, so the
 * syscall dispatcher cannot see it.  There is no exported API to register an
 * out-of-tree LSM, so we find the security_hook_list entry whose handler is
 * `target_name` and overwrite just that slot, keeping the original aside.
 *
 * The slot is located by scanning the table and matching the function pointer,
 * never by a compile-time head/field offset, so it does not depend on the
 * (possibly randomized) struct layout.  6.12 turned the table into static
 * calls; both the security_hook_list slot and the static call are updated there.
