# NekoSU

Kernel-level root for Android.

## Repository layout

```
kernel/     Kernel module (nksu)
uapi/       Kernel/userspace shared UAPI headers
manager/    Gradle root: the Jetpack Compose manager and its build
neko/       Rust tool: ncore and the JNI bridge
signing/    Signing material (release.keystore is gitignored)
```

## Build

```sh
make -C kernel                 # kernel module, needs KDIR
cd manager && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

`manager/` is the Gradle root, so the wrapper must be run from that directory.
